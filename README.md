iOS - iCloudKit

"This document gets you started creating a CloudKit app that stores structured app and user data in iCloud. Using CloudKit, instances of your app—launched by different users on different devices—have access to the records stored in the app’s database. Use CloudKit if you have model objects that you want to persist and share between multiple apps running on multiple devices. These model objects are stored as records in the database and can be provided by you or authored by the user." https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitQuickStart/Introduction/Introduction.html
